## What is this and why?
I am a web developer working on frontend projects with react, nextjs and UI libraries. I feel like I am not growing that much in this field and tried learning the server-side technologies. This project is to hone my react skill and get experience in developing a web server and a database.  
This is a minimalist replica of a issue-tracking software called [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). Although I said it is a replica, the design is inspired from an another repository. According to [Datlype](https://github.com/Datlyfe/jira_clone), his project is a clone of a clone which makes mine as **a clone of a clone of clone**. ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿

## Technologies
